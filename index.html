	 <h2> Welcome! </h2>
	<p>Until September 2023, I was a researcher at the University of Cologne working in the field of applied microeconomic theory.</p>
	<p>During this time, I often used Python to model and simulate economic situations. 
		I also applied Stata to perform statistical analyses of research data. I obtained my doctoral degree in May 2023. 
		Before my doctoral studies in economics, I completed my master's degree in mathematics at the University of Bonn.</p>
	<p>I am currently looking for a job as an actuary, data scientist, analyst, consultant or in related fields. 
		Feel free to contact me if you strive to fill such a position.</p>
